Assignment 2

Introducing Relational Databases.
1) Which field of the Customers table is the primary key?
-> cnum

2) What is the 4th column of the Customers table?
-> Rating

3) What is another word for row? For column?
	Row    -> Tuple 
	Column -> Atribute

4) Why isnâ€™t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
-> In RDBMS, rows of the table are not stored sequentially; they are not stored in any specific order.
Rows of the table are scattered(Fragmented) all over the database server Hard Disk.

Tables represent unorder sets. so there is no such thing as first five rows or last row.
