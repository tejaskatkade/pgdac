JAVA COLLECTION FRAMEWORK
- Framework provides us the architecture to manage these "group of objects" i.e. add, update, delete, search etc;
- Collection is nothing but a group of objects
- java.util pkg

- Before java collection framework, we have Array, Vector, Hash tables.
- but there is no common interface, so its difficult to remember the methods for each.
