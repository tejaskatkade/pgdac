sorting :

 - sorting refers to arranging elements insome logical order
 -  Ascending or descending

Types of sorting

 1. Internal sorting
  - If all the data i.e. to be sorted can be adjusted at a time in main memory then internal sorting methods are used.
  
 2. External sorting 
  - If all the data to be sorted can not be accomodate in the memory at the same time 
    and some has to use auxilary memory, then it is external sorting.


Stable and Not Stable Sorting :
 
 Array = [34, 67, 89, 23, 67`, 90, 34` ,56, 67``]


 After sortig
 [23, 34, 34`, 56, 67, 67`, 67`` , 89, 90]  <-- stable algorithm
      1   2        1   2    3 
     34  34        67  67   67
     
 Stable : The order of the duplicate elements does not get change. 
 If a sorting algorithm after sorting the contents,
 does not changes the sequence of similar content in which they appear, is called stabel sorting

 Unstable
 If a sorting algorithm after sorting the contents,
 changes sequence of similar content in which they appear, is called unstabel sorting.
