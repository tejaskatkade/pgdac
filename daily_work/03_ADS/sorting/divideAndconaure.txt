 * 
 * Divide and conquer is an algorithm design paradigm that solves as problem using following steps
 * 
 *  1 -> Dividing  : Breaking the problem into smaller subproblems
 *  2 -> Conquerig : solving each problem recursively
 *  3 -> Combining : Merging the solutions of subproblems to form the solution to the original problem
 * 
 *  Charecteristics :-
 *  -  1. Recursion   : divide and conquer often uses recursive technique
 *  -  2. Efficiency  : Helps to reduce complex problm into simple, managable ones;
 *  -  3. Optimal     : The problm can be broken into smaller subproblems, each of which is a problem 
 *        solution 
 *  -  4. Overlapping : Subproblem are independent and do not share the data 
 * 
 *  Advantages:
 *  1. Efficiency  : Reduce the complexity of a problem
 *  2. Parallelism : Subproblems can often be solved independently, making it suitable for parallel computing
 *  3. Modularity  : Problms are solved in modular way, improving code structure and redability
 * 
 * Disadvates -
 * 1. Space complexity
 * 2. Overhead for execution
 * 
 * May require external space due to recursive space so it can be overhead 
 * 
 * Applications-
 * 1. searching : Binary Search
 * 2. Sorting   : Merge sort  and quick sort
