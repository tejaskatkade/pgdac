oop
--------

c , cpp -> top to bottom approch
java    -> bottom to top approch

class -> collection of objects
      -> blueprint
      
--> every class has its own property and behaviors
    property  - data members
    behaviors - member functions

Need of OOP :
- To represent them in coding language

Objects are stored in heap area

constructor - use to initialize the instance variable
            - same name as a class
            - special method without return type
            - Types - default constructor
                    - parameterized constructor
                    -
